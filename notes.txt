# stdin and stdout for commands

# NUMEQUALTO value – Print out the number of variables 
# that are currently set to value. If no variables equal 
# that value, print 0.

-------

# BEGIN – Open a new transaction block. Transaction blocks 
# can be nested; a BEGIN can be issued inside of an existing 
# block. (LIFO)

# ROLLBACK – Undo all of the commands issues in the most 
# recent transaction block, and close the block. Print 
# nothing if successful, or print NO TRANSACTION if no 
# transaction is in progress.

# COMMIT – Close all open transaction blocks, permanently
# applying the changes made in them. Print nothing if 
# successful, or print NO TRANSACTION if no transaction is 
# in progress.

# Any data command that is run outside of a transaction 
# block should commit immediately. 



# The most common operations are GET, SET, UNSET, and 
# NUMEQUALTO. All of these commands should have an expected 
# worst-case runtime of O(log N) or better, where N is the 
# total number of variables stored in the database.

# The vast majority of transactions will only update a 
# small number of variables. Accordingly, your solution 
# should be efficient about how much memory transactions use.
